# Green Eats üçΩüåø
### project description 

* Building a web-app that helps users understand the carboon footprint of their meal choices
* It calculates the carbon footprint of the ingredients in a given recipe and recommends more sustainable alternatives
* The goal of the project is to have an MVP (minimum viable product).
* This means we aim at having something that works, not necessarily the best (in terms of design and range of possible visualizations/functions).

### A web application containing:
*  A tool to parse ingredients from a recipe and calculate the carbon footprint.
*  A system to make personalised sustainable recommendations.
* A dashboard to visualise the carboon footprint of the recipes/ingredients in the database.

### Background & Motiavation 
* The current worldwide food production accounts for more than a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn is the leading cause of climate change (Ripple et al. 2017).
* Consumers‚Äô food decisions can play a fundamental role in reducing the carbon footprint (Hirsch and Terlau 2015; Verbeke and Vackier 2004) by for example aligning with a more sustainable food diet, where environmentally harmful products (i.e., high in CO2 emissions) have a lower preponderance.
* CO2 emissions associated with food consumption is a relatively new and abstract concept, that consumers cannot (yet) properly digest.
* Therefore, supportive and guidance instruments are needed to help consumers make more sustainable decisions.

### Functionality 
* Input a recipe by either scraping it from food.com or by manually inputting the ingredients & quantities.
* Estimate the CO2 score per ingredients and per recipe.
* Recommend recipes that could be similar in taste, but with lower carbon footprint.
